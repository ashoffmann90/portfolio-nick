Goals:
Home Page
x I know I asked for autoplay on the reel, but can it be muted until someone clicks on it? 2. Also, can the reel stretch the entire width of the browser, no matter what size someone has it set to? 3. Can we bring the font size down a couple points on the Bio? 4. Can we also adjust the font size for each item in my steadicam kit? 4. Let's eliminate the word "His" in the section that says His Steadicam Kit 5. Can we place some bullet points or dashes next to each item in my kit and also have each item on its own line? 6. At the top where it has my name/title, I sent you a jpeg with the correct font, let's adjust that as well (on each page)

Videos Page 7. Let's bring the thumbnail size down a couple points

BTS Page 8. The photos seemed to load slowly, is there a solution to fix that? 9. It also looks like there’s some broken links in the photos section..like some of them didn’t load 10. Can you give a little “breathing room” between the words “photos/videos” and the content below them?

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
